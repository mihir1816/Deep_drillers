        "    paper_summary = \"\"\" *Quantum Communication-Based Edge Intelligence Framework for Wearable Health IoT Devices*    ## *1. Introduction*    ### *1.1. The Rise of Healthcare IoT (H-IoT)*   The rapid growth of *Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT)* has revolutionized the medical industry by enabling *real-time patient monitoring, remote diagnostics, and intelligent decision-making. Devices such as **wearable heart monitors, smart glucose sensors, and AI-driven health assistants* generate vast amounts of sensitive patient data, which needs to be securely transmitted to hospitals and medical institutions.    However, the deployment of *H-IoT networks* comes with significant *security challenges. Traditional cryptographic techniques, such as **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to the rapid advancement of **quantum computing. **Shor’s Algorithm, a quantum algorithm, can potentially break classical encryption systems, posing **a major cybersecurity threat* to healthcare networks.    ### *1.2. Security Threats in H-IoT Networks*   Healthcare IoT devices communicate over *wireless networks, making them susceptible to cyber threats such as:   - **Eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks* – Hackers can intercept medical data.   - *Data Tampering and Spoofing* – Unauthorized modification of patient records.   - *Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks* – Overloading healthcare servers, causing downtime.   - *Quantum-based Cryptanalysis* – Future quantum computers could break encryption keys.    ### *1.3. The Need for Quantum Cryptography and Edge Intelligence*   To address these security challenges, this research proposes a *Quantum Communication-Based Edge Intelligence Framework* for H-IoT networks. This framework integrates:   ✔ *Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)* – A theoretically unbreakable encryption method using *BB84 and E91 protocols.   ✔ **Machine Learning (ML)-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)* – Detects cyber threats in H-IoT networks.   ✔ *Edge Computing* – Reduces latency and improves real-time healthcare data processing.    ---  ## *2. Background and Related Work*    ### *2.1. Quantum Cryptography in Healthcare*   *Quantum Cryptography* is an advanced technique that utilizes the *principles of quantum mechanics* to encrypt and securely transmit data. The two primary *QKD protocols* used in this research are:   - *BB84 Protocol* – Uses quantum bits (qubits) and polarization states to create a secure key exchange.   - *E91 Protocol* – Uses quantum entanglement to create an unhackable key distribution system.    ### *2.2. Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection*   Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) rely on *ML algorithms* to classify network traffic as either *normal or malicious. The study evaluates the performance of:   - **Random Forest (RF)*   - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*   - *Naïve Bayes (NB)*   - *Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)*    Among these, *Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (90.51%), making it the preferred choice for securing the H-IoT network.    ### **2.3. Edge Computing for Healthcare IoT*   Traditional *cloud-based healthcare systems* introduce latency due to *data transfer* and *processing bottlenecks. By implementing **edge computing, patient data is **processed locally* on IoT devices, reducing network congestion and improving efficiency.    ---  ## *3. Proposed Framework for Secure H-IoT Communication*    ### *3.1.
